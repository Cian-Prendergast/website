## How does pigmentation occur?

Pigmentation is often associated with ageing, but one's age has actually nothing to do with it. Pigmentation occurs in both younger and older people. The related skin discolouration is the result of years of unprotected exposure to sunlight. A different name for pigmentation could also be sunspots.

## Removing pigmentation

The complete removal of pigmentation is difficult. However, there's a lot you can do to prevent or reduce pigmentation.

  * For example, use a product with a sunscreen of at least SPF 30 every day. This will prevent any (new) spots from forming.
  * Be sure to apply sunscreen to not just your face, but also your hands, neck, arms and decollete.
  * Use an additional product that contains ingredients that are proven to be effective against skin discolouration. For example, think of ingredients such as niacinamide, arbutin, vitamin C, azelaic acid, acetylglucosamine and liquorice root extract.



## Paula's Choice collection for pigmentation

The Paula's Choice collection includes several effective products for preventing pigmentation and fading existing skin discolouration.

  * RESIST DAY CREAM SPF 50 helps repair existing sun damage and counteracts the formation of new pigmentation.
  * The 10% AZELAIC ACID BOOSTER tackles multiple skin problems simultaneously. It fades pigmentation and skin discolourations caused by pimples. Moreover, it prevents the occurrence of new pimples and prevents skin ageing.
  * Thanks to its high concentration of vitamin C, the C25 SUPER BOOSTER helps to fade stubborn brown pigmentation and superficial discolouration caused by sun damage or hormonal changes.



## Buy Paula's Choice products

Does your skin also require a skincare product to fade pigmentation? Why not try a Paula's Choice Boost product? They are specially suited for this purpose.

 If you are not satisfied with your purchase, contact us within 60 days for a full refund.
