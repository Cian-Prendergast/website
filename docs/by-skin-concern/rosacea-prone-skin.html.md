If you suffer from a rosacea-prone skin, opt for a DAY CREAM WITH SPF

SPF is indispensable for rosacea-prone skin. For example, it helps prevent inflammatory reactions and skin damage caused by the sun. It's best to use a cream containing the sunscreen filters titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide with at least SPF 30. This is ideal for sensitive skin and provides direct protection against UV radiation.

## Calm your rosacea-prone skin in three steps

**Step 1: Facial cleansers** for rosacea-prone skin Rosacea-prone skin is extremely annoying. Please be kind to your skin and only use mild, soothing products. The first step in your basic routine should be to keep your skin clean with the right Paula's Choice cleanser.

**Step 2: Exfoliant** for rosacea-prone skin A BHA exfoliant cleans your pores, soothes your skin and works as an anti-inflammatory. It's the ideal product to prevent the symptoms of rosacea-prone skin, such as redness and pimples, as much as possible.

**Step 3: Creams** for a rosacea-prone skin If you have rosacea-prone skin, it's important to protect your skin from the sun. UV radiation can exacerbate inflammatory reactions. A mineral sunscreen is therefore the best choice for rosacea-prone skin.
